# ONI Mods

## Steam Workshop Upload

Use the **OxygenNotIncludedUploader** GUI tool to publish mods to the Steam Workshop.

- Path: `/home/matt/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/OxygenNotIncludedUploader/OniUploader64`
- It is a GUI application (not CLI-scriptable)
- Prepare the mod files in `~/ONI_Workshop_Upload/<ModName>/` then point the uploader at that folder
